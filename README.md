# Competitive Programming

This repository contains a collection of my competitive programming solutions, organized by various algorithmic topics. The problems are categorized into key areas like STL, greedy algorithms, binary search, BFS, and more, providing a structured approach to improving problem-solving skills. Each solution is implemented in either Golang or C++ with a focus on efficiency and clarity. Additionally, I've included a set of resources that I used for learning about the algorithms used.

## C++ Vim Template & Compilation Command

### Vim Template

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const ll LINF = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3fll;

int main() { _
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation Command
```
g++ -fsanitize=address -01 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -Wall -Wshadow -Wfatal-errors --std=c++20 -Wno-unused-result -Wno-sign-compare
```
